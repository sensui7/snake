# Snake
- This is a snake game using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library and C++. Instead of
  wall collisions, the snake can wrap around the screen. The rest of the original functionality
  remains the same.
- To run the game, extract all of the files from the .zip into a directory, and then execute "make" in a terminal

## Requirements
- You will need SDL2 installed on linux: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php

## Without compiling
- Simply execute "./snake" to run the existing game
